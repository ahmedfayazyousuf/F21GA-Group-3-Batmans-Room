# Batman's Room - 3D Diorama

**F21GA Group 3 - Dubai Campus**  
**3D Graphics and Animation Coursework - October 31 Submission**

## Project Overview

This project is my 3D diorama submission showcasing modeling, animation, and real-time rendering skills for the F21GA 3D Graphics and Animation course. I've created a detailed Batman-themed room diorama using Blender for offline rendering, Unreal Engine for animation, and WebGPU for interactive visualization.

## Project Theme

**Batman's Room** - A low-poly 3D diorama depicting Batman's personal sanctuary, combining gaming setup elements with iconic superhero theming. The room features a bed area with a prominent Batman symbol window, a full gaming station with multi-monitor setup, speakers, and all the technological elements Batman would need. The diorama blends realistic room design with superhero aesthetics, creating a functional living space that tells a story about the Dark Knight's life beyond crime fighting.
