# Interactive - Interactive Visualizer Deliverable

This folder contains the real-time interactive WebGPU application showcasing my Batman's Room diorama with user interaction. This interactive version allows users to explore the room, control lighting, and interact with various elements in real-time.

## Model Importing and Rendering

### Geometry Loading

I loaded my Blender models into the WebGPU application using [mention file format - OBJ, GLTF, etc.] parsing. The loading process involves [describe your loading pipeline - file reading, vertex parsing, etc.]. Key challenges were [file format conversion, coordinate system differences, etc.].

### Scene Construction

I built the scene programmatically, positioning each object according to my original Blender layout. The scene hierarchy is organized as [tree structure, spatial partitioning, etc.]. I used [transformation matrices, instancing, etc.] to place and render objects efficiently.

## Materials, Lights, and Shaders

### Shader Implementation

I implemented custom shaders using WGSL (WebGPU Shading Language) to render the scene with proper lighting and materials. Here are my key shaders:

#### Main Scene Shader
- **Purpose**: Handles PBR rendering with base color, normal, roughness, and metallic maps
- **Code location**: `[file path]`
- **Features**: Phong/Blinn-Phong lighting model, texture sampling, normal mapping

#### [Additional Shader Name]
- **Purpose**: [What it does - e.g., UI, post-processing, specific effects]
- **Features**: [Special techniques used]

### Materials and Textures

I implemented a material system that loads textures (albedo, normal maps, etc.) and applies them using WebGPU's texture bindings. The material pipeline: [describe your approach - PBR workflow, texture coordinate handling, etc.]. I converted my Blender materials to work within WebGPU's capabilities.

### Lighting Setup

The lighting system uses [directional/point/spot lights]. I implemented [shadow mapping/casting or simplified lighting]. The lights can be controlled dynamically through user interactions.

## Framebuffer Effects

I implemented post-processing effects using WebGPU's framebuffer capabilities:

### Effect 1: [Name - e.g., Bloom, Tone Mapping, Color Grading]
- **Purpose**: [What visual effect it creates]
- **Implementation**: [How it works in your rendering pipeline]

### Effect 2: [Additional effects]
*[List any other framebuffer effects you implemented]*

## Interaction

### Camera Controls

I implemented an exploration camera system using [WASD/arrow keys + mouse look]. The camera supports [free movement/orbit/pan-zoom]. I used [input handling library or native WebGPU code] to process keyboard and mouse events.

### Keyboard/Mouse Interactions

Here are the interactive elements in my application:

#### WASD / Arrow Keys
- **Action**: Move camera through the scene
- **Implementation**: Transforms camera position based on input direction and delta time

#### Mouse Look
- **Action**: Rotate camera view
- **Implementation**: Pitch and yaw calculation from mouse delta

#### [Additional Key - e.g., Space, T, etc.]
- **Action**: [What happens - toggle lights, spawn objects, etc.]
- **Implementation**: [Event handling code location]

### Animation Elements

I created several interactive animations: [list animations - rotating objects, pulsing lights, particle effects, etc.]. These are controlled through [keyboard input/time-based/interaction-triggered].

## Code Structure

The project follows this structure:
- **Core renderer**: WebGPU initialization, command buffers, render loop
- **Scene management**: Object loading, transformation, hierarchy
- **Shader system**: WGSL shader compilation and binding
- **Input handling**: Keyboard/mouse events, camera control
- **Material system**: Texture loading, material properties
- **Post-processing**: Framebuffer effects pipeline

Key files:
- `main.js`: Entry point, WebGPU setup
- `renderer.js`: Rendering pipeline
- `shaders.wgsl`: All shader code
- `input.js`: Input handling
- [Add your specific files]

## My Workflow and Approach

Since this was an individual project, I developed all aspects myself:
1. **Learning WebGPU**: Started with the lab template and extended it
2. **Model Import**: Adapted code to load my Blender exports
3. **Material Conversion**: Converted Blender materials to WebGPU shaders
4. **Interaction Design**: Implemented camera and keyboard controls
5. **Polish**: Added framebuffer effects and optimization

## Critical Analysis and Reflection

### What Worked Well
- [Discuss successful aspects - specific features, tools, learning curve]
- WebGPU proved to be [your experience]

### Challenges Faced
- **Biggest challenge**: [Shader debugging, texture loading, performance, etc.]
- I overcame this by [your solution]
- Learning WGSL was [reflection on difficulty]

### What Could Be Improved
- [Be honest - time constraints, complexity missed]
- Would have liked to add [features you couldn't include]

### Technical Decisions
- **Why WebGPU**: Modern API with good performance, learning cutting-edge tech
- **Shader architecture**: [Decision on shader organization]
- **Interaction design**: [Why certain controls were chosen]

## Performance Considerations

To ensure smooth performance, I implemented:
- [Specific optimizations - frustum culling, LOD, instancing, etc.]
- Maintained frame rate around [target FPS] on [hardware specification]
- Optimized shader calculations for efficiency
