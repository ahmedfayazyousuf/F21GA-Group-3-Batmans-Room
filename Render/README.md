# Render - Offline Rendering Deliverable

This folder contains the high-quality offline rendering of my Batman's Room diorama created in Blender. All models, materials, and scene setup were created from scratch to build a cohesive and detailed scene.

## Modeling Process

### Objects Created

Here I'll document all the objects I created for the Batman's Room diorama:

#### [Object Name]
- **Reference**: [Reference images or inspiration]
- **Modeling approach**: [How I modeled it - which techniques, modifiers, etc.]
- **Materials**: [Materials I applied]
- **Incremental work**: [Screenshots showing early stages]

### Background and Scene Setup

I built the room environment with dark grey walls and a light blue-grey floor, setting up proper scale and proportions. The Batman's Room features a bedroom on the left with a bed and window showcasing a prominent Batman symbol (batarang) silhouette against the blinds. A Heriot-Watt University poster adds personalization to the scene. On the right side, I created a detailed gaming desk setup with multi-monitor displays, PC tower, speakers, and a black gaming chair. A shelving unit houses various props including another CRT monitor, boxes, and other Batman-themed items. For lighting, I used [describe your lighting setup - area lights, sun lamp, etc.] to create a moody atmosphere. Camera positioning was carefully considered to show all the key elements and Batman character in the center.

### Materials and Textures

I created materials using Blender's Principled BSDF shader with a PBR workflow. Textures were either sourced from [mention if you used texture libraries] or created procedurally. I focused on making materials feel realistic - [give examples of specific materials you're proud of].

### Final Diorama Composition

For the final render, I arranged all objects to create visual balance and tell Batman's story. The low-poly Batman character stands in the center in T-pose, alongside a white dog companion. The camera angle was chosen to showcase the full room layout - from the bed area with its iconic Batman symbol window, to the detailed gaming setup on the right. I positioned all furniture and props to create depth and visual interest. The scene uses a low-poly art style throughout, with 42,090 vertices and 42,639 faces in total. I used render settings: [resolution, samples, denoising, etc.]. The final composition showcases Batman's room as both a hero's sanctuary and a functional living space.

### Technical Details

- **Render Engine**: Cycles
- **Render Settings**: [Fill in your settings]
- **Lighting**: [Number and types of lights]
- **Materials**: PBR workflow using Principled BSDF

## My Workflow and Approach

Since this was an individual project, I handled all aspects of the modeling, texturing, lighting, and rendering. Here's my process:

1. **Planning**: I started with reference images and rough sketches to plan out the scene
2. **Modeling**: Created each object with proper topology and detail
3. **Texturing**: Applied materials and textures to each object
4. **Scene Assembly**: Composed the final scene with all elements
5. **Lighting**: Set up lighting for atmosphere and mood
6. **Rendering**: Final render with optimized settings
